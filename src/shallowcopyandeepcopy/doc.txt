To copy the object's data we have several method like deep copy and shallow copy

class Rectangle {
int length = 5;
int breadth = 3;
}

object of Rectangle class : Rectangle obj1 = new Rectangle();

--shallow copy : The shallow copy one creates a new reference and points to the same
object

Rectangle obj2 = obj1;

new reference is created with name obj2 and that will point to the same memory location

--Deep copy : In a deep copy, we create a new object and copy the old object value
to the new object

Rectangle obj3 = new Rectangle();
obj3.length = obj1.length
obj3.breadth = obj1.breadth

if we change the values in shallow copy then they affect the other reference as well.
